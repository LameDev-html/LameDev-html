Hi, I'm Lam3D3v (or Aaron), and I'm a Front End Web Developer.
My pronouns are he/him, however I don't mind any other pronouns.
I am great at HTML, and I'm trying to touch up on my CSS skills, and also learn ReactJS.
I've been coding for a bit now. I started HTML a couple months back, and now working on CSS.
That's all I can think of to put in here, so bye.
